## 🛠️ Features

- **Authentication & Role-Based Access**: Secure login interface differentiating between System Admins (who manage all customers) and Customer Admins (who are restricted to their specific customer instance).
- **Customer Management**: Create, read, update, and delete customer (tenant) records.
- **User Management**: Add, update, and remove users under a specific customer, including assigning roles and verifying active statuses.
- **Billing Dashboard**: Track and visualize the processing consumption for different models and projects configured per customer. Features aggregated top-level statistic cards showing the overall Total Documents and Total Pages processed for a quick overview.
- **Interactive Charts**: Day-by-day trend analysis of documents and pages processed using interactive area charts.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Database Configuration**:
   Ensure your `.env` file is present in the root directory with the correct Microsoft SQL Server credentials:
   ```env
   DB_SERVER=...
   DB_NAME=...
   DB_USER=...
   DB_PASSWORD=...
   ```

2. **Start the Application**:
   Simply run the `start.bat` script located in the root directory. This script will automatically:
   - Activate the Python virtual environment (`venv`).
   - Boot up the FastAPI backend via `uvicorn` on port `8000`.
   - Start the Vite React development server for the frontend.

## 📝 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js (v18+)
- Microsoft SQL Server (with the appropriate ODBC driver installed, e.g., ODBC Driver 17)
